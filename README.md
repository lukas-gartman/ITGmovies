# ITGmovies
A tool to book seats and purchase movie tickets to the ITG cinema. When purchasing a ticket you are required to sign up for an account in order to keep track of your current and/or previous bookings.

This project is built with the Sinatra framework and uses Slim to create HTML pages and SQLite3 as a database management system.
